### Basics of OOPs

### Q: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), how does it differ from other paradigms, which languages support it, what are its advantages/disadvantages, and what are its main features?

**A:**  

Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm where software is structured as a collection of **objects**.  
- Each object represents a real-world entity with **data (attributes)** and **methods (functions)** that operate on that data.  
- OOP helps in building modular, reusable, and maintainable code for large-scale systems.

#### üîπ Difference from Other Programming Paradigms

![OOP Concepts Overview](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250425104200593184/oops.png)

OOPs is not the only paradigm. Some alternatives include:  

1. **Imperative Programming** ‚Äì Focuses on step-by-step instructions that change program state.  
   - *Example:* Procedural Programming (functions, routines).  
   - *Example:* Parallel Programming (dividing tasks to run concurrently).  

2. **Declarative Programming** ‚Äì Focuses on *what* to do, not *how* to do it.  
   - **Logical Programming:** Uses facts and rules (e.g., Prolog).  
   - **Functional Programming:** Builds programs by composing functions (e.g., Haskell).  
   - **Database Programming:** Uses queries to manage structured data.  

üëâ OOP differs because it models real-world problems as interacting **objects** with state and behavior.

---

#### üîπ Common OOP Languages
Some widely used languages that follow OOP principles are:  
- **C++**  
- **Java**  
- **Python**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **C#**  
- **Ruby**

---

#### üîπ Advantages of OOPs
- ‚úÖ **Reusability:** Code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism.  
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability:** Easier updates and modifications.  
- ‚úÖ **Security:** Data hiding via encapsulation.  
- ‚úÖ **Scalability:** Works well for large, complex systems.  
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility:** Easier to redesign and extend.  

---

#### üîπ Disadvantages of OOPs
- ‚ùå Requires developers to think in terms of objects, which may not be intuitive.  
- ‚ùå More **planning and design effort** needed.  
- ‚ùå Not suitable for every problem domain.  
- ‚ùå Programs can become larger compared to procedural approaches.  

---

#### üîπ Main Features of OOP (4 Pillars)
1. **Encapsulation** ‚Äì Binding data and methods together while restricting direct access.  
2. **Abstraction** ‚Äì Showing only essential details, hiding implementation.  
3. **Polymorphism** ‚Äì Ability of methods/functions to behave differently based on context.  
4. **Inheritance** ‚Äì Deriving new classes from existing ones to promote reusability.

### Classes, Objects, and Memory

### 7. What is a Class?
- A class is a building block of Object-Oriented Programs.
- It is a user-defined data type that contains the data members and member functions that operate on the data members.
- It is like a blueprint or template of objects having common properties and methods.

‚úÖ Example in C++:
```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int speed;

    void drive() {
        cout << brand << " is driving at " << speed << " km/h" << endl;
    }
};
```

---

### 8. What is an Object?
An **object** is an **instance of a class**.  
- It is a real-world entity that has a **state** (data/attributes) and **behavior** (functions/methods).  
- To access a class‚Äôs members, we first need to create an object of that class.  

‚úÖ Example:
```cpp
Car myCar;         // Object creation
myCar.brand = "Tesla";
myCar.speed = 120;
myCar.drive();     // Output: Tesla is driving at 120 km/h
```
---
### 20. How much memory does a Class occupy?
- A **class itself does not occupy memory**. It only defines the **structure** and **behavior** of objects.  
- Memory is allocated **only when an object is created** from the class.  
- The memory consumed by an object depends on:
  - The **size of its data members**.  
  - Any **memory alignment/padding** done by the compiler.  

üëâ Example:  
```cpp
class Example {
    int x;    // 4 bytes
    double y; // 8 bytes
};
```

---

### 21. Is it always necessary to create objects from a class?
- **No**, it is not always necessary.  
- If a class contains **static members or static methods**, they can be accessed **directly using the class name** without creating an object.  

‚úÖ Example:
```cpp
class MathUtils {
public:
    static int square(int n) {
        return n * n;
    }
};

int result = MathUtils::square(5);  // No object needed
//However, if you want to access non-static members, you must create an object.
```
---
### 22. What is the difference between a structure and a class in C++?

| Feature | Structure (`struct`) | Class (`class`) |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Default Access Modifier** | Members are **public** by default | Members are **private** by default |
| **Declaration Keyword** | Declared using `struct` | Declared using `class` |
| **Use Case** | Traditionally used for **grouping simple data** | Used for **modeling complex entities** with both data & behavior |
| **Inheritance** | Supports inheritance but rarely used for it | Fully supports inheritance and polymorphism |
| **Encapsulation** | Less commonly used for encapsulation | Strongly supports encapsulation |

‚úÖ Example:
```cpp
struct Point {
    int x, y;   // public by default
};

class Rectangle {
private:
    int length, width;  // private by default

public:
    void setDimensions(int l, int w) {
        length = l;
        width = w;
    }
    int area() {
        return length * width;
    }
};
```

### Core OOPs Principles (4 Pillars)

### 10. What is Encapsulation?
![Encapsulation](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230119164955/encapsulation.png)

Encapsulation is the process of **binding data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit**.  
It ensures that sensitive data is hidden from external users and can only be accessed through controlled interfaces.  

#### Key Implementations:
- **Data Hiding**: Restricting access to members of an object using access specifiers like `private` and `protected` in C++.  
- **Bundling Data & Methods Together**: Data members and the functions operating on them are wrapped into a single unit called a **class**.  

---

### 11. What is Abstraction?
![Abstraction](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230125135240/abstraction.png)

Abstraction is the concept of **showing only the necessary information** while hiding the implementation details.  
It focuses on **what a system does** rather than **how it does it**.  

#### Implementation in OOP:
- **Classes**: Hide the implementation details and provide a clean interface.  
- **Interfaces & Abstract Classes**: Define contracts without exposing internal logic.  

---

### 12. What is Inheritance? What is its purpose?
Inheritance is the process where a class (**child/derived class**) acquires properties and behaviors (data & methods) from another class (**parent/base class**).  

- The derived class can reuse and extend the functionality of the base class.  
- The **main purpose of inheritance** is:
  - **Code reusability**  
  - Achieving **runtime polymorphism**  

---

### 13. What is Polymorphism? What are its types?
![Polymorphism](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250425165615062960/polymorphism.png)

The term **Polymorphism** means *"many forms"*.  
It allows the same function, operator, or method to behave differently depending on the context.  

#### Types of Polymorphism:
1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static/Early Binding)**  
   - Binding of function call is resolved at compile time.  
   - Examples:  
     - **Function Overloading**  
     - **Operator Overloading**  

2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic/Late Binding)**  
   - Actual implementation is determined at runtime.  
   - Example:  
     - **Function Overriding** using virtual functions in C++.  

---

### 16. Are there any limitations of Inheritance?
Although inheritance is powerful, it comes with drawbacks:  
- **Slower Execution**: Since it may involve multiple classes, execution time can increase.  
- **Tight Coupling**: Child and parent classes are closely linked; changes in the base class may affect derived classes.  
- **Complex Implementation**: Misuse of inheritance can lead to unexpected errors or incorrect outputs.  

---

### 17. What are the different types of Inheritance?
![Types of Inheritance](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240730171935/Types-of-inheritance.webp)

Inheritance can be classified into **five types**:

1. **Single Inheritance**  
   - A child class derives directly from one base class.  

2. **Multiple Inheritance**  
   - A child class derives from more than one base class.  

3. **Multilevel Inheritance**  
   - A child class derives from a class which itself is derived from another base class.  

4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**  
   - Multiple child classes derive from a single base class.  

5. **Hybrid Inheritance**  
   - A combination of two or more types of inheritance.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Support for inheritance types depends on the programming language.  
> Example: **Java does not support multiple inheritance** directly, but allows it through interfaces.

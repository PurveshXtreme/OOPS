### Basics of OOPs

### Q: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), how does it differ from other paradigms, which languages support it, what are its advantages/disadvantages, and what are its main features?

**A:**  

Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm where software is structured as a collection of **objects**.  
- Each object represents a real-world entity with **data (attributes)** and **methods (functions)** that operate on that data.  
- OOP helps in building modular, reusable, and maintainable code for large-scale systems.

#### 🔹 Difference from Other Programming Paradigms

![OOP Concepts Overview](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250425104200593184/oops.png)

OOPs is not the only paradigm. Some alternatives include:  

1. **Imperative Programming** – Focuses on step-by-step instructions that change program state.  
   - *Example:* Procedural Programming (functions, routines).  
   - *Example:* Parallel Programming (dividing tasks to run concurrently).  

2. **Declarative Programming** – Focuses on *what* to do, not *how* to do it.  
   - **Logical Programming:** Uses facts and rules (e.g., Prolog).  
   - **Functional Programming:** Builds programs by composing functions (e.g., Haskell).  
   - **Database Programming:** Uses queries to manage structured data.  

👉 OOP differs because it models real-world problems as interacting **objects** with state and behavior.

#### 🔹 Common OOP Languages
Some widely used languages that follow OOP principles are:  
- **C++**  
- **Java**  
- **Python**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **C#**  
- **Ruby**

---

#### 🔹 Advantages of OOPs
- ✅ **Reusability:** Code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism.  
- ✅ **Maintainability:** Easier updates and modifications.  
- ✅ **Security:** Data hiding via encapsulation.  
- ✅ **Scalability:** Works well for large, complex systems.  
- ✅ **Flexibility:** Easier to redesign and extend.  

---

#### 🔹 Disadvantages of OOPs
- ❌ Requires developers to think in terms of objects, which may not be intuitive.  
- ❌ More **planning and design effort** needed.  
- ❌ Not suitable for every problem domain.  
- ❌ Programs can become larger compared to procedural approaches.

#### 🔹 Main Features of OOP (4 Pillars)
1. **Encapsulation** – Binding data and methods together while restricting direct access.  
2. **Abstraction** – Showing only essential details, hiding implementation.  
3. **Polymorphism** – Ability of methods/functions to behave differently based on context.  
4. **Inheritance** – Deriving new classes from existing ones to promote reusability.
